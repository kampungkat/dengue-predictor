## Problem Statement

Singapore, with its tropical climate and urban landscape, has long been susceptible to outbreaks of dengue fever. In an effort to combat this public health challenge, we introduce an advanced prediction model designed to forecast dengue cases in Singapore. Leveraging historical data on weekly dengue cases, as well as key environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, our model employs cutting-edge machine learning techniques to provide accurate and timely predictions. By anticipating potential outbreaks up to eight weeks in advance, this model aims to empower healthcare authorities and policymakers with the insights needed to implement proactive measures, thereby reducing the impact of dengue fever on the community.

## Scope
This project aims to analyze the trends of several features from historical data to forecast possible dengue cases in Singapore. There is also a cost-benefit analysis of one of the government's efforts to combat dengue fever, namely Project Wolbachia, to justify whether or not the government should continue with the ongoing project.
